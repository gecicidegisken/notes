This garden contains my reading notes, code snippets, and other resources (usually) related to computer science. I am trying to keep it as organized as possible but please note that for now, it is a personal project and might not fit everyone's needs. Some notes can be Turkish, some can be English and some can be both. Some of them even uses a language that only I can understand. :D

For my blog, which includes organized posts, please see [sibervepunk home](https://sibervepunk.com).
